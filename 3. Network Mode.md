BlazorQuery provides 3 Network Modes to determine how **Queries** and **Mutations** behave 
when there is no network connection. You can set the mode per query/mutation or globally 
via `QueryClient.DefaultNetworkMode`.

The default is `Online`, meaning queries will only execute when a network connection is available. 

# Network Mode: Online

Queries and Mutations only execute when online. If a fetch cannot happen, the query will 
remain in its current state (Loading, Error, Success), but an additional fetch status is exposed: 

- Fetching: query is actively executing.
- Paused: query is paused until network is back.
- Idle: query is not fetching and not paused.

Convenience flags: IsFetching and IsPaused.

If a query is running and the network goes offline mid-fetch, retry will pause and 
resume once the connection returns.

`RefetchOnReconnect` defaults to `true` (stale queries will refetch when network reconnects). 

# Network Mode: Always

- Queries always fetch, ignoring network state. 
- Queries are never paused.
- Retries do not pause; the query will enter Error state if it fails.
- `RefetchOnReconnect` defaults to `false`.
- Useful for queries that do'’t require a live network, e.g., reading from local cache or 
returning `Task.FromResult()` in `QueryFn`. 

# Network Mode: OfflineFirst

- A middle ground between **Online** and **Always**.
- The query executes once, then pauses retries if offline.
- Useful for offline-first scenarios, e.g., service worker caching or HTTP cache.
- The first fetch may succeed from the cache, but if there's a cache miss and network fails, 
retries will behave like **Online**.
