# Query Retries in BlazorQuery

When a query fails (the query function throws an exception), **BlazorQuery** will automatically retry 
the query if the number of consecutive retries has not exceeded the limit specified 
in the query options.

You can configure retries both on a global level (via `QueryClient` defaults) and 
on an individual query level (`QueryOptions<T>`).

### Retry Options

- Setting `Retry = 0` will disable retries.
- Setting `Retry = 3` will retry failing requests 3 times before throwing the final exception.
- Custom retry logic can be provided via `RetryFunc: Func<int, Exception, bool>`, 
allowing conditional retries depending on the attempt number or exception.
- Retries apply only when an exception is thrown from the query function.
- Infinite retries are supported via `RetryInfinite = true`.

```csharp
var queryOptions = new QueryOptions<string>(
    queryKey: new QueryKey("todos", 1),
    queryFn: async ctx => await FetchTodoListPageAsync(),
    staleTime: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
    networkMode: NetworkMode.Online,
    refetchOnReconnect: true,
    retry: 5 // Retry up to 5 times
);

var resultQuery = new UseQuery(queryOptions, queryClient);
```

# Retry Delay

Retries in BlazorQuery are not immediate. A backoff delay is applied between retry 
attempts to reduce load and collisions.

By default, retries in **BlazorQuery** uses exponential backoff with jitter for retries:
- Initial delay is 1000ms.
- Delay doubles with each attempt (2^attempt * 1000ms).
- A random jitter of up to 300ms is added to prevent collisions.
- Maximum delay is capped by `MaxRetryDelay` (default: 30 seconds).
- Optionally, a custom retry delay function can be provided via 
`RetryDelayFunc: Func<int, TimeSpan>`.

```csharp
int delayMs;
if (_queryOptions.RetryDelayFunc != null)
{
    delayMs = (int)_queryOptions.RetryDelayFunc(attempt).TotalMilliseconds;
}
else
{
    double expDelay = Math.Pow(2, attempt) * 1000;
    double jitter = new Random().NextDouble() * 300;
    delayMs = (int)Math.Min(expDelay + jitter, maxRetryDelay.TotalMilliseconds);
}

await Task.Delay(delayMs, cancellationToken);
```

# Custom Retry Delay

- Provide a custom delay function via `RetryDelayFunc: Func<int, TimeSpan>`.
- The function receives the current attempt index (0-based) and returns a `TimeSpan` 
to wait before the next retry.
